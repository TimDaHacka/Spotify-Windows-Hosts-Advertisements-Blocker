# Spotify Windows Hosts Advertisements Blocker
A very simple batch script which edits the Windows Hosts file in order to block Spotify advertisement domains.
## Important Note
Depending which drive you have Windows installed on, you may have to edit the batch script slightly in order to have it work. Also I have only tested this on the Spotify Desktop version. Therefore, I do not know if it will work with the web version or the Microsoft Store version.

## What Does This Do Exactly?
In order to block advertisements on Spotify, you would have to add the advertisement domains into your Windows Hosts file. But not many people know how to do that therefore this batch script automatically does it for you and even makes a backup of your original Windows Hosts file.
## What Was The Point In This Project?
Although it is good to support Spotify (which I recommend), not everyone has money for premium including myself. Therefore I searched for ways to block the advertisements and eventually found this script which was in Spanish at first. And since not everyone can understand or read Spanish, I decided to recode the script and translate it to English.
## Should I Use The .bat or The .exe?
I recommend you use the executable file as this script requires the use of Administrator rights since it is ending tasks and deleting files which require the Administrator's rights. Although if you do not trust my executable file, you can always just download the batch file instead and manually run it as Administrator.
